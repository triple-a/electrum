/*
Package electrum provides an Electrum protocol client implementation.

The client supports two kind of operations, synchronous and asynchronous; for simplicity must
methods are exported as sync operations and only long running methods, i.e. subscriptions,
are exported as asynchronous.

Subscriptions take a context object that allows the client to cancel/close an instance at any
given time; subscriptions also returned a channel for data transfer, the channel will be
automatically closed by the client instance when the subscription is terminated.

The client supports TCP and TSL connections.

# Creating a Client

First start a new client instance

	client, _ := electrum.New(&electrum.Options{
	  Address:   "node.xbt.eu:50002",
	  KeepAlive: true,
	})

# Synchronous Operations

Execute operations as regular methods

	version, _ := client.ServerVersion()

# Subscriptions

# Get notifications using regular channels and context

	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30 * time.Second)
	defer cancel()
	headers, _ := client.NotifyBlockHeaders(ctx)
	  for header := range headers {
	  // Use header
	}

# Terminating a Client

When done with the client instance free-up resources and terminate network communications

	client.Close();
